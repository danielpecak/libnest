libNeST Documentation
=====================
libNeST stands for library for Neutron Star Toolkit. It contains a variety
of tools that help handling in the complicated physics of neutrons stars.
The aim is to use and learn about physics of nuclear matter inside a neutron
star without thinking about complexity of Skyrme functionals or data format.
